        heralds:  
            title: Heralds
            p1: The name herald comes from Old French “heralt” and was originally a medieval officer in Europe who was in charge of carrying messages to the kings of opposing armies and back again. Not a mere messenger, he was a pre-form of diplomat as he would make public proclamations, arrange ceremonies, verify noble titles, declare war and announce peace. During the high Mid Ages, heralds were in charge of all the etiquette of chivalry and became responsible for the creation and regulation of the armorial bearings of the nobles.
            p2: As they were referred to as being neutral, they would succeed as intermediaries between both armies. Thus they could pass on messages among the defenders of a castle or reign and its besiegers and negotiate the surrender of one of the armies. Many times right after a bloody battle it would be the herald’s duty to distinguish and recognize dead warriors by identifying their crest or Coat of Arms.
            p3: It was also the herald’s task to select duelists during tournaments according to their Arms. He would publicly announce the combatants and make known the winner. It was also his responsibility to see which opponent would be in favor in the duel where the sun would not shine on his face.
            p4: Heralds clothing is basically formed by a coat, called "tabard", decorated with the coat of arms of their lord.
            p5: Nowadays, heralds are specialists in everything that refers to heraldry and Coat of Arms. The herald still divulges royal weddings or the acclamation of kings in present day monarchy.

            curiosity:
                title: Historical curiosity
                p1: At some stage in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, during the Hundred Years’ War between England and France, an English and French herald observed the decisive combat together at the top of a nearby hill. The English army had about 11,000 men and was evidentially outnumbered by almost 30,000 Frenchmen and knights. Nevertheless, both heralds agreed that England would win the conflict due to visible tactics.  Thus, Henry V, King of England, would be given the right to name the battle.* (Keegan, 1983, pg.74-77; 104-105) While France lost 6,000 men, England was victorious with a loss of less then 450 knights.

        coat_of_arms:
            title: Coat of Arms
            p1: In the Medieval European tradition, a Coat of Arms, also known as Family Arms when it refers to the insignia of a specific family, was known to be a set of heraldic emblems with the intent to identify individuals, families, clans, organizations, cities, regions, and also nations. It is commonly represented upon a shield, which is the homonymous weapon of defense of medieval warriors. However, it can be seen as a representation on flags, banners, attire, personal objects, and much more.
            p2: A Coat of Arms was granted by a king as a manner to honor noblemen and knights for their deeds and bravery as they have become a symbol of status and power during their period. These emblems were mainly used in battlefields in order to distinguish friend from foe, and to choose an opponent worthy to clash with.
            p3: Such emblems and insignias were created by the heralds that gave the guarantee that each Coat of Arms was distinctive and exclusive and were recorded in register books under their care and attention.
            p4: The first known Coats of Arms were formed in full colors. Later they would receive divisions on shields during combat, which would refer to the courts. Soon after they would gain fantastic figures such as lions, dragons, unicorns, eagles, deers, and an infinite number of other creatures, figures and symbols. Another interesting point is that certain designs were strictly reserved for royalty alone from different kingdoms and nations.
            p5: All colors and symbols assume a proper significance. This allows the art to transform itself into science.
            p6: It is important to notice that the Coat of Arms is not defined visually, but by its written description, which is carried out in its own language known as heraldic language.
            p7: The art of designing Coat of Arms is also referred to as blazoning from Old French “blason” which etymology is not quite clear, that denoted the shield of arms itself, and now describing a Coat of Arms. Right after reading the description of Arms, there is a set of rules to follow that are somewhat restrict that makes sure that the art is being prepared correctly and with the precise details and similarity. These rules refer to the most important piece that is the shield, and to the exterior ornaments such as the crown, elms, cloaks and lieutenancy.

            family:
                title: Family Coat of Arms
                p1: Apart from the war condition, the Coat of Arms passed on to the heraldic science ambit within symbols of nobility, ecclesiastic hierarchy, civil and military corporations, sports and domain. Families began to receive Arms with heraldic features by hierarchy due to certain deeds and deserving actions with the kingdom that was conserved as an icon of glory and honor.
                p2: It is important to notice that most of the population did not know how to read or write during the Middle Ages, and it was through these designs that families could be undoubtedly identified by most anybody.
                p3: With the passing of time, even the most prominent citizens that did not have noble blood running in their veins received Arms by the end of the Middle Ages. Since then heraldic insignias have been passed on from generation to generation and may be modified through matrimony.
            
        how_is_found:
            title: How a Coat of Arms is found?
            p1: During the Middle Ages, the heralds were in charge to register the Coat of Arms in books that were taken under their care. Nowadays these Coat of Arms are gathered in books called Armorials. One may contain the Coat of Arms of an entire single country or a group of nations. In some cases it may include the history of the origin of the family name.
            p2: Some Armorials have the Arms in a descriptive form, referred to as heraldic language, where the herald takes this information and designs the family Coat of Arms. Other books, nevertheless, already come with a visual form of the heraldic insignia.
            p3: Gilberto Guzenski works as a herald since 1967, and has dozens of exceptional books containing official Arms. All together come to the amount of several thousands of family names, which is his principal source of research.

        heraldry:
            title: Heraldry
            p1: It is by the means of the art and science of Heraldry that the Coat of Arms is studied and produced, interpreting origins, the symbolical and social significance of families, groups, nations and institutions.
            p2: A system of heraldic emblems was developed in order to distinguish knights beneath heavy armor in a battlefield and facilitate the gathering of the warriors around their flag.  A classification of unique insignias was created for each nobleman known as the Coat of Arms that would clearly appear on each knight’s shield and, above all, the flag.
            p3: The word Heraldry, as according to some scholars in which the initial meaning of the term herald is in dispute, comes from the Anglo-Saxon “har” and “haren” that means “to scream” or “to shout out”.
